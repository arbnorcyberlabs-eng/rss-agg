### For Regular Websites

```toml
[your-feed-name]
title = "Your Feed Title"
url = "https://example.com/page"
entrySelector = ".article"          # CSS selector for each article
titleSelector = "h2 a"              # CSS selector for title
linkSelector = "h2 a"               # CSS selector for link
contentSelector = ".summary"        # (Optional) CSS selector for content
```

### Then Commit and Push

```powershell
git add feeds.toml
git commit -m "Add new feed: Your Feed Title"
git push
```

GitHub Actions will automatically:
1. Detect the change
2. Generate the new feed
3. Update your website

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Feeds Not Updating?

1. **Check GitHub Actions:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/arbnorcyberlabs-eng/rss-agg/actions
   - Look for failed workflows (red X)
   - Click to view error logs

2. **Common Issues:**
   - Website changed their HTML structure → Update CSS selectors
   - Website blocked scraping → Add delays or user agent
   - Selector doesn't match → Test in browser DevTools

### Website Not Loading?

1. **Verify GitHub Pages is enabled:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/arbnorcyberlabs-eng/rss-agg/settings/pages
   - Should show: "Your site is live at https://arbnorcyberlabs-eng.github.io/rss-agg/"

2. **Wait a few minutes** after enabling (first deployment takes longer)

3. **Check for errors** in browser console (F12)

### Test CSS Selectors

Before adding a feed, test selectors in browser:

1. Open the website you want to scrape
2. Press F12 (Developer Tools)
3. Go to Console tab
4. Test selector:
   ```javascript
   document.querySelectorAll('.your-selector')
   ```
